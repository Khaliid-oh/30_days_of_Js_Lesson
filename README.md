# 30 Days JavaScript Challenge


### Welcome to my 30 Days JavaScript Challenge! This is a challenge designed to help me learn and improve my JavaScript skills in just 30 days. Each day I will learn a new JavaScript concept and complete a series of challenges to reinforce what I've learned.

Getting Started
To get started with the challenge, you'll need to have some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you're new to web development, don't worry! We've included some resources to help you get started.

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory and open the index.html file in your browser.
Follow the instructions for each day and complete the challenges.
Structure of the Project
The project is organized into 30 folders, one for each day of the challenge. Each folder contains an index.html file, a styles.css file, and a script.js file. The HTML file contains the markup for the page, the CSS file contains the styles, and the JavaScript file contains the code for the day's challenge.

Resources
If you need help with a concept or a challenge, there are a number of resources available:

The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) is a great resource for learning JavaScript.
The JavaScript documentation on MDN is also very helpful.
The W3Schools website is another good resource for learning JavaScript.
You can also ask for help on Stack Overflow or in the GitHub Discussions section of this repository.
